Software Developer and Maker who has acquired a versatile skillset in various challanging projects at work and in my free time. Doing so, I learn new things with enthusiasm. 

My interests include computer vision, sensors, cloud computing, edge computing, automatization, technology in agriculture, (I)IoT, machine learning and much more.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Searchwing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin, Java
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about visual detection and tracking of small objects and birds in particular.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I partly live on a house boat.
